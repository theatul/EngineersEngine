<p>Hi...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for being interested in the <b>engineersengine.com/articles</b> . As name suggest EngineersEngine.com
Is all about technology and its study as Engineering student ( specially Indian but as we should know 
and believe that Engineers are same all over the world unaffected by limitations of country and religion.
So I am  sure others will find this place useful  too.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question may raise at your mind that why one more site for engineering students and engineers 
when there are lodes of others already available. The answer is simple we have many sites available but
only handful of them are completely devoted to study and if there are some then they belongs to some 
institution/university or provide only small amount or unorganized data and help for students. In a 
country as big as India which produce about 8 lakh engineers per year a place like <b>www.EngineersEngine.com</b>
Will be very helpful where an student can get there books ,project help, Technical tutorials ,Presentations,
  Latest technical news specially organized for there university, branch and year . Our team believes that 
  it will help to improve the quality of engineers produced by India as well as make it easy for engineering students to emphasis on good books and contents instead of wasting time on searching good contents.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Engineering student during my study I felt that we Indians are very famous for our piracy habits although the reason is very simple that we do not have access money like some developed countries to invest on services which can be available for free. But even then the piracy is crime and not acceptable morally also (All programmers reading this may feel the pain of the stealth of there hard worked source code). So our team has decided get rid of this piracy habit at least at one area. You may think that we can not make another windows and open source is already there as alternative but I am not talking about software. So then what kind of piracy I am talking about Movies ? (I don’t  think it is proper place to talk about that because then I have to open NOFORPIRETEDMOVIES.com). So I am talking about books. We can not make another windows and can not pay for that but what about books? a country famous for bright and talented engineers/doctors can not even produce books for its students?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I as well as our team believe we can! So we are planning to make the largest open database for engineering books made by Indian students with the help of their faculty/department and organized according to there universities, Branch and semester . The project will be launched soon you can take part on this even before starting by mail me at <b>A@engineersengine.com</b> offering your or your college/department help or  any suggestion/comment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end I want to tell you that <b>www.EngineersEngine.com</b>is at under construction so we are trying 
Every idea to make it better for you and we welcome all the suggestion and help to improve this website and its services so please mail me at <b>A@engineersengine.com</b> for any suggestion/comment.<br> </p>
