The salesman announces sadly, "Time to buy a new car!" <br>

Says the hardware engineer, "Well, first let's try swapping the front and rear tires, and see if that fixes it."<br>

Replies the software engineer, "Now, let's just try driving the car again, and maybe the problem will go away by itself."<br>
